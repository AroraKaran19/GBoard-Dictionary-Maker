### *What is a GBoard Dictionary? Why do u need to make one?*
A GBoard Dictionaries allow GBoard- The Google Keyboard to display word suggestion pop-ups whenever you start typing. These suggestions save a lot of our typing time, right?<br>
Now, GBoard also allows you to create many such custom dictionary elements, like keybindings, e.g., you type in "hey" and boom! you get an entire sentence "Hey There! This is Jennifer" as a suggestion, which you can tap and automatically type in an entire sentence that quickly.
<br>

### *How does one create one?*
Gboard Settings>Dictionary>Personal dictionary>All languages>Then tap on the "+" icon and create shortcuts.
<br>

### Okay that seems easy, so what's the point of this project?
Well, imagine you have to make 100 such shortcuts. You'll follow the steps above, then go to the previous menu, then again tap the "+" icon, repeat for 100 times? That's exactly why we made this project. GBoard-Dictionary-Maker can create mutiple such shortcuts in bulk on a single window and then generate a Gboard importable zip!

<br>

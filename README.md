## THIS TREE SERVES AS A CONSOLE BASED IMPLEMENATION OF THE PROJECT
### [Serves as a legacy branch for users who (for any reason) is unable/don't want to install tkinter ]

IF YOU SOMEHOW ENDED UP HERE UNINTENTIONALLY, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO REFER THE MAIN BRANCH FOR UPDATED CODE. That said, 'minimalism' enthusiasts for whom a GUI isn't a deal can continue using this. There might be little bugs here and there (i noticed one with path yesterday), I'll fix them whenever  get time.
